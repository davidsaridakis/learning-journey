# learning-journey
A place to create some personal projects and develop my overall skillset.

This is my first repository. I have a couple of projects that I want to start with that relate to my previous experience in the culinary world and as a teacher. The plan is to build them here to improve my programming/coding ability and to show consistency in my educational journey.

The first project is a simple website for an international themed pop-up restaurant.

The second is one I hope to be a bit meatier. I would like to create an application that helps chefs find employers and vice versa. Ideally this model will be used by various proessions and industries, and in particular I want it to be able to help language learners and local tutors connect too.
